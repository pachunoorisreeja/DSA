🧩 LEVEL 1 — BASIC ARRAY PATTERNS
🧠 Pattern 1: Traversal (Basic Looping)

Focus: Looping through arrays, indexing, printing, basic manipulation.

#	Problem	Platform	Skill
1	Print elements of an array	Any (write your own)	Basic for loop
2	Find the sum of all elements	LeetCode / GFG	Accumulator logic
3	Count even and odd numbers	Self	If-else + loop
4	Count numbers > given value	Self	Condition inside loop
5	Find the number of positive, negative, zero elements	GFG	Loop & conditions

💡 Practice writing loops using both for and while.
